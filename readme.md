### SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

A class needs to have only one responsibility and objective.

The benefit of this is having a better organization of responsibilities and functionalities. It also improves the maintainability of your projects because if you need to make changes, they will be highly isolated within the specific class. This means that modifying one class won't require changes in other classes.

Additionally, if you want to add more methods, having isolated classes allows you to add them to the specific class without impacting other parts of the code.
