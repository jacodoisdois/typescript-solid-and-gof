### SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

A class needs to have only one responsibility and objective.

The benefit of this is having a better organization of responsibilities and functionalities. It also improves the maintainability of your projects because if you need to make changes, they will be highly isolated within the specific class. This means that modifying one class won't require changes in other classes.

Additionally, if you want to add more methods, having isolated classes allows you to add them to the specific class without impacting other parts of the code.


### OCP - Open/Closed Principle 

Classes, funcitons, etc.  should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In essence, the behavior of a system can be extended without modifying its source code. This principle aids in maintaining the stability, robustness, and reusability of a software system, minimizing the risk of introducing new bugs when implementing changes.


### LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
