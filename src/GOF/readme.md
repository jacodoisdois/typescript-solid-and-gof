### Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern providing an interface for creating objects in a superclass, allowing subclasses to alter the object type created. Instead of using constructors, object creation is delegated to a factory method. This pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories sharing a common theme. It simplifies code, enhances flexibility and scalability, making it easier to add new subclasses without disrupting existing client code. It solves the problem of tightly coupled code by decoupling the client from the concrete classes.
